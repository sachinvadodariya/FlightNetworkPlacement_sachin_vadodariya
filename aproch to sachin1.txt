***********************************APPRAOCH TO FIRST PROGRAM*****************************

** In given program I implemented Stack using C langauge.
** I have chosen C language because it is easy to implement Stack using linked list. 
** PUSH and POP operations are implemented under SWITCH CASE block.
** I have used IF ELSE statements for next data to be entered by user which must be the next integer.
** values which are popped are attached to another linked list. 
** All popped out values are then printed accorinding which they are popped.
