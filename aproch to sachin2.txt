*************************************APPROACH TO SECOND PROBLEM**********************************


** HERE WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT PROBLEM USING IN CIRCULAR QUEUE IN C LANGUAGE.
** HERE I HAVE CREATED CIRCULAR QUEUE FIRST USING 'FOR()' LOOP.
** AFTER CREATING CIRCULAR QUEUE THERE IS A WHILE LOOP THAT COUNTS UNTIL ONE KID IS DECLARED AS WINNER.
** THERE IS ANOTHER WHILE LOOP THAT COUNTS UNTIL GIVEN 'N' NUMBER.
** NUMBER FIRST NOT ELIMINATED KID IS FIRST SAVED IN ONE VARIABLE AND THEN COMPARED TO NEXT UN-ELIMINATED KID.
** IF THE NEXT KID IS THE SAME THEN THAT KID IS DECLARED AS WINNER.
